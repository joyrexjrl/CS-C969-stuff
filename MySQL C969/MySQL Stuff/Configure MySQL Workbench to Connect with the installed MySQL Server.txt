To configure MySQL Workbench to connect with the installed MySQL Server, follow these detailed steps:

---

 Step 1: Launch MySQL Workbench

- Open MySQL Workbench by clicking on the application icon.

---

 Step 2: Add a New Connection

1. Click the + button next to MySQL Connections on the main Workbench dashboard.
2. The "Setup New Connection" dialog box will appear.

---

 Step 3: Configure the Connection Settings

In the dialog box, fill in the following fields:

1. Connection Name:  
   - Provide a name for the connection (e.g., "Local MySQL Server" or "MySQL Dev Server").

2. Connection Method:  
   - Select Standard (TCP/IP), which is the default.

3. Hostname:  
   - If MySQL Server is running on the same machine, enter localhost.
   - If the server is remote, enter the server's IP address or hostname.

4. Port:  
   - Enter 3306, the default MySQL port (or another port if you configured a different one).

5. Username:  
   - Enter root (or another MySQL user you created).

6. Password:  
   - Click Store in Vault (or Set button depending on the version).
   - Enter the password you created during the MySQL server installation and click OK.

 Step 4: Test the Connection

1. Click the Test Connection button.
2. If the connection is successful, you'll see a confirmation message:  
   - "Successfully made the MySQL connection."
3. If the test fails:
   - Check that the MySQL Server service is running. 
     - You can verify this by searching for Services in the Windows start menu and confirming that the MySQL service (e.g., MySQL80) is running.
   - Ensure the port, username, and password are correct.
   - Ensure your firewall allows MySQL traffic on port 3306.

 Step 5: Save and Connect

1. Click OK to save the connection.
2. On the main dashboard, click the new connection tile to open a session with the MySQL Server.

---

 Step 6: Run a Sample Query (Optional)

1. In the SQL editor, type a simple query such as:
   sql
   SELECT VERSION();
   
2. Click the Execute button (lightning icon) to run the query.
3. The results pane will display the MySQL version information.

 Additional Configuration (If Needed)

- Modify Connection Timeout:  
   - Navigate to Edit > Preferences > SQL Editor.
   - Increase the DBMS connection read timeout value if the connection times out frequently.

- Set a Default Schema:  
   - After connecting, you can right-click a database in the Navigator pane and select Set as Default Schema.
